Hi, i am Adrian.
This is my personal website.
In the future, I might blog about various topics including technology, movies and traveling.

I grew up in Gütersloh, finished school in 2010 and did my civil service in a retirement home.
After that, i studied computer science in Paderborn, graduated in the summer of 2014 and went to Helsinki for one semester abroad in the winter of 2014.
I recently finished my master degree at the Technische Universtität Berlin.

As i am quite curious and open-minded, I really enjoy trying out and learning new things.
I was also a Toastmaster fellow and received my *Competent Communicator  Award* 2 years ago.

My PGP key fingerprint is [`B21C 1490 ECC9 06C0 89F1  7FBD 1F64 B092 C957 6401`](../misc/pgp-key.asc).
